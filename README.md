# New File for VSCode

Create new files from your keyboard.

## Usage

There's only one shortcut: `cmd+alt+n`/`ctrl+alt+n`.

By default, it uses the current workspace folder as the root path. You can
override it by typing `~` to render the home dir, or `/` to render the root dir.

To create directories, just add a `/` to the end of the path.

If a file already exists on that given path, `new-file` will open the file
instead.
